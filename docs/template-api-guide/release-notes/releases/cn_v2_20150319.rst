What's new
----------

The Cloud Networks Getting Started Guide now includes installation instructions
and usage examples for the neutron client. The neutron client provides a
simple, command-line interface to the Cloud Networks API, similar to the nova
client for Cloud Servers and the trove client for Cloud Databases. All these
clients are actually executing cURL operations in the background.
