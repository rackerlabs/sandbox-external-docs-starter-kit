Update an image

    PATCH /v1.0/images/{imageId}

This operation updates the specified image. You can update only an image that
you own.

You can use the HTTP PATCH method to update certain standard properties, and to
add, update, or remove custom, user-defined image properties.

Following are some guidelines for updating custom, user-defined properties.

- You can add custom properties to your image. We recommend that you name a
  custom property by prefixing your domain or name. You may not use
  ``com.rackspace`` as the prefix. For example, ``com.mycompany.myproperty``
  and ``myname.myproperty`` are valid, but ``com.rackspace.myproperty`` is not
  allowed. Do not use the prefix ``org.openstack`` because OpenStack might add
  a property with the same name.

  You can delete any custom property that you previously added to your image.

  You can update any custom properties that you previously added to an image
  that you own, and you can update the following standard properties:

  - ``name``
  - ``tags``
  - ``os_distro``
  - ``os_version``
  - ``protected``
  - ``container_format`` (Changing this value might render your image
    unusable.)
  - ``disk_format`` (Changing this value might render your image unusable.)
  - ``min_disk`` (Changing this value affects what flavors you can use with the
    image.)
  - ``min_ram`` (Changing this value affects what flavors you can use with
    the image.)
  - ``ramdisk_id`` (Applies only when ``disk_format`` has a value of ``ami``.)
  - ``kernel_id`` (Applies only when ``disk_format`` has a value of ``ami``.)

- In general, you can update any properties that you own, but do not expect to
  be able to update anyone else's properties. For example, you can't update any
  properties starting with ``com.rackspace``, and you might not be able to
  update some properties starting with ``org.openstack``.
