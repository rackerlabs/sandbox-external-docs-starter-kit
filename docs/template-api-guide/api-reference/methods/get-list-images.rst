List images
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

    GET /images

Lists public virtual machine (VM) images.

This operation returns images you created, shared images that you accepted, and
standard images.

This operation returns a subset of the larger collection of images and a link
that you can use to get the next set of images. Always check for the presence
of a ``next`` link and use it as the URI in a subsequent ``GET`` request.
Follow this pattern until a ``next`` link is no longer provided. The next link
preserves any query parameters that you send in your initial request. You can
use the ``first`` link to jump back to the first page of the collection. If you
prefer to paginate through images manually, use the ``limit`` and ``marker``
parameters.

The List Images operation accepts several types of query parameters that you
can use to filter the results of the returned collection.

A client can provide direct comparison filters by using most image attributes,
such as ``name=Ubuntu``, ``visibility=public``, and so on. A client cannot
filter on tags or anything defined as a link in the json-schema, such as
``self``, ``file``, or ``schema``.

You can use the ``size_min`` and ``size_max`` query parameters to perform
greater-than and less-than filtering of images based on their ``size``
attribute. The size is measured in bytes and refers to the size of an image
when it is stored on disk.

For example, sending a ``size_min`` filter of 1048576 and size_max of 4194304
filters the container to include only images that are between 1 MB and 4 MB in
size.

You can sort the results of this operation by using the ``sort_key`` and
``sort_dir`` parameters. The API uses the natural sorting of whatever image
attribute is provided as the ``sort_key``.

.. note::
   Public images may reach end-of-life and be removed from the base image list.
   The :how-to:`Hidden Base Images <hidden-base-images>` article lists images
   which have been removed from the base images list but which may still be
   available.


Request
-------

The request has the following query parameters.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 10 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Type
     - Description
   * - limit
     - String
     - Requests a specific page size. Expect a response to a limited request
       to return between zero items and the number specified. The typical
       pattern for using the ``limit`` and ``marker`` parameters is to make an
       initial limited request and then to use the ID of the last image from
       the response as the ``marker`` parameter in a subsequent limited
       request.
   * - marker
     - String
     - Requests a specific page size. Expect a response to a limited request
       to return between zero items and the number specified. The typical
       pattern for using the ``limit`` and ``marker`` parameters is to make an
       initial limited request and then to use the ID of the last image from
       the response as the ``marker`` parameter in a subsequent limited
       request.
   * - name
     - String
     - Specifies the name of the image as a string.
   * - visibility
     - String
     - Specifies image visibility as either ``public``, ``private``, or
       ``shared``.
   * - owner
     - String
     - Specifies images shared with the user by the specified tag.


This operation does not accept a request body.
